# About My Life As An Internet Icon
* Hello! I'm Anwir Prota! I enjoy Web Development & Programming. My favorite MLs are HTML, AIML & CSS. For programming I'm fluint in JavaScript & Python3. 
* I plan on learning Go, React, and Node.js.

# About My Life As A Person
* Decent people are strange and foreign to me. I never really was one. I've always been busy while other people were working and I'd see it that they were building and typing and things, and I was never rlly a part of that. I had very important things to do. I guess what I wanted to do was take three test tubes, and just a small sample of flesh, and break it down, you know. 
* As a child I always wanted to see how things work. Someone would hand me a rattle and I'd think "what makes that rattle?" So i bit it and chewed it and tore it apart until I found the little beads in the rattle. So ofc, after that i became quite the fan of rattles. :)
