# About My Life As An Internet Icon

In 2017 I started trolling as a Fandom user. In 2018 my friend Diaz and I formed AZ. He left, and my friend Mcneary joined, later along with Rutherford, Arneson, and Gam as we made a political informative site together. Eventually people started to despise our views and in that our site was shut down, but vandals and other users like DeLoominarty and SquiddyPepe, Robert The Republican and Agents of SHIELD joined. Eventually Wikipediocracy, DCSC, and Pax Politica joined the cause and we migrated to Discord where we met multiple clans that also partnered with us. Eventually however our clan collapsed into disaray and fell apart in December 2019. 

Throughout 2020 I ran multiple raid clans and developed multiple big hits on the Discord platform like the Daybreak Repl Scraper. In early 2021 I returned to Fandom and made a last big movement with the Terrible's Legio. After that I created Heretik Developers which also broke up. 

Now adays I just vibe with my two homies Arciye from Crimson Spade and Chis from Neo-MaraSalvatrucha1337.
